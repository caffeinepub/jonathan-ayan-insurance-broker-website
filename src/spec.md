# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the website deployment URL from the draft domain to a custom production domain.

**Planned changes:**
- Configure the Internet Computer canister to use a custom domain instead of the draft .icp0.io URL
- Update any hardcoded URL references in the codebase to use the new domain
- Ensure Internet Identity authentication works with the new URL
- Set up appropriate redirects from the old draft URL to the new production URL

**User-visible outcome:** The website will be accessible via a professional custom domain URL instead of the draft deployment URL, with all functionality including authentication working seamlessly.
