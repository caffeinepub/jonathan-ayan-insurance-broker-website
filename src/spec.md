# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the insurance company logos in the CompaniesSection to display completely without cropping.

**Planned changes:**
- Adjust the logo container dimensions and styling in CompaniesSection.tsx to prevent cropping
- Modify object-fit properties and padding to ensure full logo visibility
- Update aspect ratio constraints to maintain proper logo proportions for all five carriers

**User-visible outcome:** All five insurance company logos (Mutual of Omaha, Transamerica, Ethos, Fidelity and Guaranteed Life, and Forrester) will be fully visible without any portions being cut off, while maintaining their correct aspect ratios.
