  "summary": "The diff implements comprehensive error logging and validation across frontend and backend as specified. REQ-65, REQ-66, and REQ-68 are fully addressed with detailed console logging, form validation, and default values. However, REQ-67 backend error logging and validation is missing - the backend submitContactForm method lacks error handling, validation logic, and logging for storage failures.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-67",
      "requirement": "In the backend main.mo actor, verify the saveContactFormSubmission method correctly handles all required fields and add error logging for any validation or storage failures",
      "reason": "The backend submitContactForm method in main.mo does not include any validation logic for required fields, no error handling for storage operations, and no error logging. The method simply creates a ContactFormSubmission and calls submissions.add() without try-catch blocks, validation checks, or logging.",
