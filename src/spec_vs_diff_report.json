  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to CompaniesSection.tsx that implement the requested logo display fixes. The component now uses fixed-height containers (h-[200px]) with reduced padding (p-6) and object-contain styling to prevent logo cropping. All five carrier logos are present, and the '+25 other carriers' indicator card is maintained. The implementation aligns with REQ-28's requirements.",
