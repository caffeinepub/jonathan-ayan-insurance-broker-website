  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-58, REQ-59, REQ-60, REQ-61) are fully implemented. The diff shows: (1) ContactSection.tsx replaced time/day dropdowns with hour selector (12-hour format, 24 options) and day-of-month dropdown (1-31); (2) useQueries.ts mutation hook correctly submits bestTimeToContact and bestDayToContact as strings; (3) AdminPanel.tsx displays both columns with human-readable formatting ('Best Time to Contact' and 'Day' prefix). No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
